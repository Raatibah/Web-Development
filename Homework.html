     <h2 id="Sports">Sports</h2>
     <p>Sports is really crucial for health. My favorite sport is Badminton and Handball. I have been a champion in Handball and I am the best at Goal keeping. I have played Badmintons in Winter and Summer vacations only as Badminton is not really a focused sport in my institution. The most focused sport is Handball and Football. Even though i do not play Badminton that much, it is still my favorite.</p> <br><br><br>
     <h2 id="Reading">Reading</h2>
     <p>Reading helps to improve our vocabulary and strengthens our knowledge. We should all read books to spend our time. I like to read books of the genre mystery with a little bit of politics. I also like to read books with comedy.</p> <br><br><br>
     <h2 id="Chess">Playing Chess</h2>
     <p>Chess improves our problem-solving skills, strengthens our concentration and enhances our memory. I like to play chess free time with my brother who is fortunately very skilled at chess. Chess can be fun and also intense.</p> <br><br><<br>
     <h2 id="Coding">Coding</h2>
     <p>Learning Coding helps us in digital literacy, logical-thinking and problem- solving. Nowadays, with the existence of AI, Coding is a lot easier and less time consuming.Thanks to my mother's idea, I am now learning coding at Codinzy. I am currently learning Web Development. Learning Coding helped me a lot in my Computer Practical subject.</p>
