       <h2>My Family Members</h2>
       My family consists of me, my mother, my father and my 3 other siblings. I have an older sister and two younger brothers. My older sister is in the same school as me and she is in 11th grade. My two younger brothers study in Mastermind. The older brother is in 3rd grade and the younger brother who is the youngest in our family is in KG-2. My mother is an Accountant and my father is a Doctor.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
       I have 4 hobbies. They are:<br> 1. Playing Chess <br> 2. Playing Sports <br> 3. Coding <br> 4. Reading <br><br><br> Playing Chess: Chess improves our problem-solving skills, strengthens our concentration and enhances our memory. I like to play chess
    free time with my brother who is fortunately very skilled at chess. Chess can be fun and also intense.<br><br><br> Playing Sports:Sports is really crucial for health. My favorite sport is Badminton and Handball. I have been a champion in Handball and
    I am the best at Goal keeping. I have played Badmintons in Winter and Summer vacations only as Badminton is not really a
    focused sport in my institution. The most focused sport is Handball and Football. Even though i do not play Badminton
    that much, it is still my favorite. <br><br><br>
    Coding: Learning Coding helps us in digital literacy, logical-thinking and problem- solving. Nowadays, with the existence of AI,
    Coding is a lot easier and less time consuming.Thanks to my mother's idea, I am now learning coding at Codinzy. I am
    currently learning Web Development. Learning Coding helped me a lot in my Computer Practical subject.<br><br><br> Reading: Reading helps to improve our vocabulary and strengthens our knowledge. We should all read books to spend our time. I
        like to read books of the genre mystery with a little bit of politics. I also like to read books with comedy.
